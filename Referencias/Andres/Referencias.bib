abstract = {Water sanitation is one of the biggest challenges nowadays. The sixth sustainable development goal of the 2030 agenda of the United Nations focuses on the importance of clean water and sanitation worldwide. El Rosario parish (Ecuador) was founded in 1991 and has never had a sanitary sewer system and a wastewater treatment system since. The households of the 47 hectares directly discharge domestic wastewater to a stream which flows into Daule river. This river is the primary source of drinking water for more than 4 million people that live in the province of Guayas. It implies problems with health, hygiene, and significant environmental impacts. This paper aims to develop a technical proposal for the design of sewerage and wastewater treatment, through technical analysis of the area of study, mitigating environmental and health impacts. The methodological process includes: (i) acquiring relevant data like current population, information related to the drinking water system and water supply, topography, weather, and water resources; (ii) layout of primary, secondary, and tertiary branches of the sanitary sewage system; (iii) calculation of the direction of nearby water resources' drainage that lead the layout of primary and secondary branches of the storm sewage system; and (iv) analysis for the selection of the wastewater treatment system, capacity, location, and design. As a result, this work proposes the design of stabilization ponds implanted in 14.2 ha with 26 km of sanitary and storm sewer networks in a separative sewage system. In addition, the execution of the proposal is estimated for 9.5 months for a value of approximately USD 2,157,100.35. This solution will mitigate the pollution of the Daule river and improve the life quality of the inhabitants of the rural community.},

@article{Hegarty2021,
abstract = {This study investigates water quality along the river Liffey in Dublin city with the help of citizen scientists, including the community of river users such as paddle boarders and those accessing the river from the bank. The primary objective was to evaluate water quality near sources of pollution observed by citizens, while filling data gaps for the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, Indicator 6.3.2. The participants used field chemistry kits to measure nitrate (NO₃-N) and phosphate (PO₄-P) at 19 locations on a monthly basis over the course of nine months, recording the results on a smartphone app. 10% of nitrate samples were indicative of low quality water values while 35.6% of phosphate samples were indicative of low quality water. Rainfall over the study period was analysed to investigate the impact of run-off from rainwater on the river. Results indicated that excessive rainfall was not a factor in lower water quality in this area. Citizen scientists' observational notes and photographs entered onto the database, with accompanying test results were key to highlighting pollution sources at specific locations which correlated with high levels of nitrate and phosphate resulting in low quality water. Land use was a factor in these areas of recent housing development indicating possible domestic misconnections. Citizen scientist data has the potential to fulfil UN SDG 6, in contributing to Indicator 6.3.2 while detecting contamination.},

abstract = {The water quality of six important rivers in Haihe River Basin, including Yongding River, Luanhe River, North Canal, Daqing River, South Canal and Chaobai River, was evaluated. The influence of point source and non-point source on water quality was analyzed. The causes of water environmental pollution in the major rivers were preliminarily revealed. The results show that the water quality of Chaobai River is good, and the impact of point source and non-point source discharge on the water body is small. Other rivers are affected by different degrees of point source and non-point source pollution. Based on the analysis results, the engineering measures and management countermeasures for river regulation are put forward.},

@article{Morita2021,
abstract = {This work presents an overview of environmental studies performed in areas affected by dumpsites and non-sanitary landfills in Brazil, focusing on physicochemical analysis of surface water, groundwater, and soils, as well as geophysical surveys. The objective was to identify the main contaminants found in these areas and to assess their environmental impact, guiding possible intervention measures, indicating the priority areas, and showing whether post-closure activities are mandatory. The results should support governmental actions, especially considering the recent approval of Brazil's new sanitation framework. The present review assessed 162 publications, which described 104 different municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal sites. The physicochemical parameters of analyzed surface water, groundwater, and soil samples were above Brazilian legislation levels in 74%, 70%, and 24% of the studies, respectively. The parameters more frequently above permissible levels were coliforms, biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, and phosphorus for surface water; lead, coliforms, and iron for groundwater; copper, cadmium, lead, and zinc for soil. The results indicated that Brazilian dumpsites are causing negative impacts in surrounding soils and water resources, posing ecological and public health risks that persist even after the site's closure. Considering that this study provides only a reduced scenario, the dimension of this environmental problem in Brazil is noteworthy. Therefore, it is suggested that not only inadequate disposal is prohibited, but also efficient enforcement methods are adopted and aftercare is appropriately regulated in the country, making it obligatory to establish monitoring plans and implement mitigation techniques to avoid abandoning potentially contaminated areas.},
